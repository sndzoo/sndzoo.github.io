# [](#overview)The Software Network Data Zoo

<img align="left" width="200" height="200" style="margin-right: 30px" src="https://github.com/sndzoo/logo/raw/master/sndzoo_logo_small_trans.png">

The *software network data zoo (SNDZoo)* is an open collection of software networking data sets aiming to streamline and ease machine learning research in the software networking domain. Most of the published datasets focus on, but are not limited to, the performance of virtualised network functions (VNFs). The data is collected using fully automated NFV benchmarking frameworks, such as [tng-bench](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-benchmark) [[1], [2]](#references).

All data sets are archived in their own GitHub repository using [data version control (DVC)](https://dvc.org) as technology to manage and version the contained table- and time series-based data. If you are working in the software network domain, you are welcome to [contribute](#contribute) your own data sets to this project.

Containernet is a fork of the famous [Mininet](http://mininet.org) network emulator and allows to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers as hosts in emulated network topologies. This enables interesting functionalities to build networking/cloud emulators and testbeds. One example for this is the [NFV multi-PoP infrastructure emulator](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu) which was created by the [SONATA-NFV](http://sonata-nfv.eu) project and is now part of the [OpenSource MANO (OSM)](https://osm.etsi.org) project. Besides this, Containernet is actively used by the research community, focussing on experiments in the field of cloud computing, fog computing, network function virtualization (NFV), and mobile edge computing (MEC).
