Containernet is a fork of the famous [Mininet](http://mininet.org) network emulator and allows to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers as hosts in emulated network topologies. This enables interesting functionalities to build networking/cloud emulators and testbeds. One example for this is the [NFV multi-PoP infrastructure emulator](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu) which was created by the [SONATA-NFV](http://sonata-nfv.eu) project and is now part of the [OpenSource MANO (OSM)](https://osm.etsi.org) project. Besides this, Containernet is actively used by the research community, focussing on experiments in the field of cloud computing, fog computing, network function virtualization (NFV), and mobile edge computing (MEC).
